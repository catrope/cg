OpenGL framework
================

This zip-file contains a very simple OpenGL framework that you can use as a basis
for the programs you will create for the Computer Graphics course.

You will find build files for both Linux/Unix/OS X as well as Microsoft's IDE for Windows (Visual Studio).

Linux/Unix/OS X
---------------

For Linux/Unix/OS X you need only two files: openglframework.c and Makefile. You can remove the rest of the files and directories if you would like to unclutter your directory structure.

Building is simply:

  make


Visual Studio
-------------

The rest of the files and directories help in supporting Visual Studio (it includes a copy of freeglut).
